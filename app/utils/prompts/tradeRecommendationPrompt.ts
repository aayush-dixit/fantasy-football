Respond only with a JSON array of 3 trade objects. Each object in the array must have the following structure:

            "sends": [

            ],
          },
          "otherTeam": {
            "teamId": [id],

        "rationale": [rationale],
      },
        ...
      ]
    }
  }

Do not include any explanation or text â€” only return the array of 3 trade objects in valid JSON format.`;
